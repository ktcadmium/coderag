## Summary

These files document 10+ debugging sessions focused on the MCP integration issue. Key findings have been consolidated into `memory-bank/troubleshooting.md` for active reference.

**Status**: The core technical issue (Claude Desktop MCP access) remains unresolved but is now understood to be a deployment/containerization challenge rather than a protocol implementation problem.
